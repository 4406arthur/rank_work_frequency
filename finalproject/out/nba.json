Let's imagine they were interchangeable. Let's take a few facts about one man's career and apply them to the other.\n", "\nIn the 2014 NBA Finals against San Antonio, Jordan is averaging 27.3 points, 7 rebounds and 4.3 assists. Jordan is shooting 60 percent from the field, 70 percent from three-point range, and 79 percent from the free-throw line. Jordan has committed 15 turnovers against the Spurs, but he also has 10 steals.\n", "\nStill, Jordan's ", " trail 2-1, partly because Jordan did not get to finish Game 1. Oh, of course, Jordan tried his best to finish the game, despite debilitating cramps -- he literally played until his body couldn't move any more and he had to be carried off the court.\n", "\n*****\n", "\n", "\n", "\nIn the 1996 NBA Finals against Seattle, LeBron James averaged 27.3 points. 5.3 rebounds and 4.2 assists. He also shot 42 percent from the field, 32 percent from three, 84 percent from the line. He averaged three turnovers per game, and in the deciding Game 6 against the Sonics, he had as many turnovers (five) as made baskets (five, on 19 shots).\n", "\nIn fact, in the last three games of those '96 Finals, James shot 37 percent, with 11 turnovers. Nonetheless, James' ", " won, and James was once again named Finals MVP.\n", "\nJames was hailed as the greatest individual talent in history, but did not reach the Finals in his first six seasons with the Chicago Bulls. Critics said he was more concerned with scoring than winning. Only in 1991, when James's teammate ", " emerged as one of the best players in the world, did James finally win a title. James had an uneasy relationship with Pippen for a while -- he famously mocked him for having migraines during a crucial Game 7, the kind of relentless ripping that sometimes made James unpopular with his Chicago teammates. Eventually, James and Pippen became the best pair of teammates in the league, by far -- devastating opponents on offense and defense.\n", "\nIn 1993, after winning his third title with Chicago, James suddenly retired, saying he wanted to watch the grass grow. He then played minor league baseball for a while, rather than try to compete for a fourth straight title. James' Chicago Bulls won 55 games without him, thanks to an MVP-quality season from Pippen.\n", "\n*****\n", "\nIn 2010, Jordan was considered the best player in the NBA, but he had only led his ", " to one NBA Finals in his first seven seasons. Jordan then left Cleveland to join forces with ", " and ", " in Miami. Jordan carried the Heat to two of the next three NBA championships (with a third possible this week). Meanwhile, the Cavs dropped from 61 wins to 19 the year Jordan left.\n", "\n*****\n", "\n", "\n", "\nWell, well. What do we think of that? It was a little weird, of course -- pretending Jordan played for the Cavs, then left, seems like another twist of the knife in Cleveland's stomach. But mostly, the exercise reveals more about us than about Jordan or James.\n", "\nWe have compared them for years, but we don't compare fairly. We decide Jordan is superior to James, more of a true champion, and then we use the facts to support our conclusion, even when they don't.\n", "\nCan you imagine what the amateur psychologists would say if James retired from the Heat after this season, then decided to play minor-league baseball? I'm going to take a wild guess here and say he would not be praised for his mental toughness. And what if James was spotted at a casino past midnight on the night before a playoff game, as Jordan once was?\n", "\nLook, nobody has to sell me on how great Jordan was. I know. I saw it. We all did. But in the last few years, we have done something I thought was impossible:\n", "\nWe have overrated Michael Jordan.\n", "\nReally. That's what we have done. What an incredible feat, America. ", " We have taken one of the great athletes in history and declared him perfect.\n", "\nEverybody remembers Jordan's iconic shot over Utah's ", " to win his final championship. And maybe a few people point out that he pushed off, which was illegal but also a savvy veteran move; Jordan knew that with the way the game was called, and with his stature and the moment, that the refs would not whistle him for a push-off. But how many people realize Jordan missed 17 of 26 shots the game before that?\n", "\nThat is not a criticism of Jordan. At 35, he was still the best player in the world, a rare feat, and one that James will probably not be able to match. Praise Jordan all day and night. Call him the best ever, and I won't argue the point.\n", "\n", "\n", "\nStill, on some level, all this genuflecting before Jordan has sapped us of our appreciation of LeBron James. It's not just driven by self-promoting talking-heads, either; Jordan is ingrained in the minds of most NBA fans. He is the standard. And so James' 2010 defection to Miami looked even worse than it was because we are so sure Jordan never would have done it. James' accomplishments the last few years are diminished, in our minds, because we are convinced Jordan's were more impressive.\n", "\nAnd it's happening again right now. Viewed objectively, James has had a fantastic Finals. His shooting percentages are ridiculous: 60 percent from the field and 70 percent from three-point range? Those are empty-gym numbers. The cramps were unfortunate, but hardly a character indictment; reasonable, intelligent people understand that he did everything he could to play in the game. And in Game 3, when the Spurs were hitting (almost literally) every shot they took, James scored 12 straight points to at least make a comeback possible. It was a Man vs. Machine Finals game, and the Machine won, but I can't wait to see what the Man does in Game 4.\n", "\nYes, James has 15 turnovers, which is way too many. (He had seven in Game 3, part of a team-wide problem when Miami was clearly anxious to make up its huge deficit as fast as possible.) Did anybody notice he also has 10 steals? Does this matter?\n", "\nJames is such an easy target that when he says, as he did last week, that he is the \"easiest target in sports,\" people take shots at him for complaining. On some level, it's understandable. He has wealth, fame, and as much talent as any player in NBA history. It's annoying, isn't it? Worse, he seems to want everything on his side -- when ESPN reported this week that the Heat will try to add ", ", you could see millions of eyes roll.\n", "\nWell, maybe if the Cavs had drafted a player as good as Scottie Pippen to play alongside him, James would be winning championships in Cleveland right now. It didn't happen. He is in Miami. That's reality. And if you love basketball, then you can see this guy may be in the middle of an all-time great Finals.\n", "\nOn the base of the statue of Jordan at the United Center in Chicago, these words are inscribed:\n", "\n", "\n", "\n", "\n", "\nThe first line is based on observation.

{"content": ["Welcome back to ", ", our ongoing interview series with influential members of the Twitter measurement universe. This week, we\u2019re happy to highlight ", ", New Media Specialist for the NBA Champion ", " basketball team. Coming off a terrific championship season and an Olympic gold medal for Team USA player and Miami HEAT forward ", ", we thought it would be a great time to get Jim\u2019s views on Twitter measurement. ", " Welcome Jim! Can you describe your role in the HEAT organization? How have you used social media, specifically Twitter, as a part of your social media strategy for the team?", " Our New Media team is the eyes and ears of HEAT fans around the globe. Our job is to connect with as many HEAT fans as we can. We create relationships with our younger fans that will evolve into a strong brand loyalty. We view Twitter as the first true means of establishing two-way communication with our fans. ", "Our franchise is just entering our 25th season, so we are a relatively young franchise. We are just starting to see our first generation of life-long HEAT fans reach fiscal maturity. It is our goal to take advantage of the amazing team we have to build our fan base and social media, and Twitter specifically, allows us to reach out and communicate with fans. ", "We use Twitter to provide real-time coverage of all HEAT related news and events. Our New Media team covers all HEAT practices, games and provides behind-the-scenes coverage of HEAT related events. ", " How important is measurement of engagement on Twitter to your strategy? Do you have specific goals and campaign metrics that you use to measure performance and success?", " Measurement of social media engagement is key for us. While we may not have specific goals for each initiative we undertake, engagement metrics play a key role in our future initiatives. We like to look at the performance of our tweets and use that data to tailor our coverage to the areas we get the most engagement. We always want to deliver the content our fans want the most. ", "We also like to use this data to determine time of posting. We want our posts to generate a lot of replies and we try to provide as many answers as time and scheduling allow. Conversely, pictures and posts that will generate a lot of re-tweets are often made during our \u201coff  hours\u201d since less attention is required. ", " Has your social media measurement strategy changed as you\u2019ve gone from the regular season, to the playoffs, to the champion series, to the off-season? ", " During the season, we utilize a lot of the measurements to build our strategy. Each regular season, we find a different tweeting \u201csweet spot.\u201d  Some years we see more interactions of pictures, some years it may be statistical information that gets the best response. Our job during the regular season is to perfect our strategy. Socially, we do not want to be become a nuisance.", "I come from an email marketing background. Email marketing has always been referred to as \u201cpermission-based marketing.\u201d Moving over to social media, I always treat it as \u201cprivilege-based marketing.\u201d We have been lucky to earn a spot in our fans\u2019 timelines and newsfeeds. We treat this as a privilege. We try to avoid straight sales pitches, instead offering exclusive first looks or first opportunities to buy. This gives our sales pitches a more exclusive, offer-based characteristic. ", "Once we hit the post-season, we intensify our social media efforts. We know that our fans\u2019 appetite for information increases and we begin traveling to away games to help provide coverage to which they may not otherwise have access. This coverage increases each round, as fans want more and more information. During the 2012 NBA Finals, we sent two staff members to Oklahoma City to cover everything, and we were rewarded with a really comprehensive behind the scenes look at the team during our title run. ", "Our off-season strategy is to provide relevant content when it occurs, but more so to focus on increasing our interactions with fans. We try to reply to as many relevant mentions as we can, while also increasing the amount of interactive tweets we send out. ", " What\u2019s your opinion on the \u201csecond-screen experience\u201d during televised games? Have you seen more consumers actively engaging via Twitter during games and how do you make the most of that for the team?", " During the regular season, we work very closely with our broadcast partner, Sun Sports/Fox Sports Florida. Last off-season, we had a series of social-broadcast meetings and were able to develop a very interactive broadcast. We developed a Facebook Friday component to help draw viewers to our broadcasts, especially when our local broadcast is up against a national broadcast of the game. ", "We also got our broadcasters Eric Reid and Tony Fiorentino on Twitter and they were able to interact with fans and answer some questions live during all broadcasts. Additionally, we created a dedicated hashtag to track all comments.", "Fans were also actively engaged in twitter polls for the pregame spotlights as well as the poll question for games. We wanted to create a very social feel for our broadcasts and are very happy where they stand after our first season. ", " Can you describe one of your more successful social media efforts? Were there specific measurement goals you wanted to achieve and how did the campaign perform? Any lessons learned you can share with our audience?", " I think one of our most successful efforts this year was the unveiling of our new ", ". We knew this would generate buzz, but the scope of the appeal was amazing. We were able to reach over 4.5 million unique accounts and generate almost 17 million impressions. ", "We also made a big social media push for the release of our Miami Floridians throwback jersey. This effort reached over 5.8 million unique people and total impressions reached 13 million. ", "I think the most important thing we took from these campaigns was that we needed to be ready and able to take advantage of these situations the moment they arise. Once we noticed the feedback, the posts, and tweets we were receiving, we really ramped up our efforts. We learned that by monitoring early reaction to a post you can really ride the positive public sentiment and stay ahead of the curve.
