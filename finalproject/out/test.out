The increasingly stringent worldwide regulations for marketing to children.", "In his Kids and Apps Session, Espinosa, who joined Apple at the kid-like age of 14 and is the company\u2019s longest-serving employee, surveyed this thorny territory with an upbeat cadence reminiscent of Mr. Rogers. Despite the complexities, he explained to the eager developers, Apple has a plan\u2014and it\u2019s a good one. The nut of the COPPA regulations (Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act, circa 2000) concern the conditions under which developers and game companies can target users under the age of 13 with their products (and attendant advertising) and if they can collect any form of persistent data about them.", "Online privacy and marketing to children are important issues, if you bother to think through the implications of what your children may do and be exposed to on their interactive devices, but face it, most parents glaze over about this stuff. The more expedient concern is often appeasing the tykes so we can get back to our email, ESPN ScoreCenter, Pinterest pinboards and fuddy-duddy Facebook feeds.", "This need for speed has created ", " as we realize that our (adult) iTunes accounts have become overrun with Pretty Little Liars, Thomas The Train and A$AP Ferg. You see, in order to sidestep those COPPA regulations and the (very real fear) that Junior will run up in-app purchases on Contract Killer, Apple has not allowed kids under 13 to have their own iTunes accounts. In order to provide a semblance of persistent play, it did allow younger children to have their own identity-free Game Center accounts in iOS, but this did nothing about the mingling of the familial iTunes account.", "The annoyances of this arrangement have grown as Apple has tried to increase the convenience of the user\u2019s experience by synching everything with iCloud. With each software update family members would all of a sudden have access not only to each other\u2019s purchased content and games but also their email and text message accounts. Surveilling your children may be useful at times, but being surveilled ", " them is intolerable!", "And the next set of software developments are bound to make this muddle even worse. Artificial Intelligence (AI) powered recommendation and personalization services are the next big thing after ubiquitous cloud services. The demands of competition with other platforms, notably Google, Facebook and Microsoft and a cohort of nascent startups massing for acquisition by the same, is driving this trend, but so is the wearables market that Apple hopes to dominate with its forthcoming iWatch. Small screens, short timeframes and mobility require that the precise bits of appropriate content be curated with lightening speed.", "Fortunately for Apple, its developers ", " its customers, the new Family Plan it announced at WWDC will mostly solve these problems and be a big win for all concerned. The secret? Allowing kids under 13 to have semi-autonomous iTunes accounts under the management (and credit card) of a parent. By making this management easier than the anarchic alternative, Apple is effectively offloading some of the responsibility for COPPA compliance on to the parents of the children the law is designed to protect. Don\u2019t want Junior to play Gun Bros (or blow $600 on an \u201cApathy Bear?\u201d) Decline the notification from the little rascal!", "The way the Family Plan works is that one parent becomes the administrator of the family account and invites the other family members for a total of up to six people. The linked iTunes accounts need to share the same payment method. Once this is all in place, the children can make purchases\u2014with parental approval\u2014and all family members ", " have access to all of each other\u2019s purchases.", "This potential part is important because the Family Plan sits on top of Apple\u2019s existing parental controls. In this context, if a family member does not have permission to view R-rated movies, for example, these will not even be visible (to that family member) on the list of the parent\u2019s purchases from which the child can choose.", "In practical terms this has three main implications. For the members of the family groups themselves it means the end of the enforced identification of each member with the primary iTunes account. This should make integration of iCloud services easier because automatic syncing will lead to fewer \u201cfalse positives.\u201d It will also make each family member\u2019s iTunes experience more curated since they will not find their devices automatically downloading Hannah Montana episodes.", "The bigger news for app developers, both within Apple and third-party, is that curation and personalization of recommendations are\u00a0", " easier to do when a user\u2019s training data is not contaminated by that of their kid sister or boomer dad. If Apple uses this capability wisely, and makes it available to outside developers, it could net significantly increased purchases per family member. Yes, the mom or dad will get automated alert messages that they will need to respond to when their kids want to make purchases, but the kids are automatically logged into the payment method so, from a management perspective, the approval takes but a single click.", "Here\u2019s where it gets just a little evil. The same pressure to placate the impatient children still exists, but to pass COPPA rules the parent needs to sign off on each purchase. So parents will still find themselves saying \u201cyes\u201d to things they have not properly considered, but now ", " are responsible, not Apple or the manipulative game developer or exploitative content producer. Clever, Apple, very clever!", "The most interesting aspect of this to me culturally is that", " . That\u2019s it! No legal status, no bloodlines, just pure consumerism. I can imagine this seeming disruptive to people who define family in more traditional terms. Gay marriage is still about defining an emotional commitment between people, but the Apple \u201cfamily\u201d is a purely economic construct whose defining characteristic is the clarity of the resulting data and the ease of revenue growth!", "It is easy to see how the Apple Family Plan could play out among groups of roommates or other intentional communities. If the idea takes hold, look for the phone companies and even Amazon Prime to follow suit. The post-modern family has been moving in this direction for years, towards being an economic and cultural interest group, and the spread of mobile devices and cloud services is quickening the pace. Apple has no choice but to try to fix the mess it has made of family\u2019s media collections and personal data, but the solution has cultural implications it may not be anticipating.", "On purely practical terms, I am looking forward to the clarity that the Family Plan will bring to ", " family.

This new philosophy coincides with a yet-to-be-seen product lineup that Apple\u2019s senior vice president Eddy Cue has called ", ". The intersection of the new openness with Apple\u2019s forthcoming devices is the most important shift of the Tim Cook era. It will determine whether Apple is poised to retain its spot as the world\u2019s most valuable company and, in some ways more importantly, its reputation as the leading innovator in the mobile era.", "In the spirt of the company\u2019s proclamations, this space will look at the \u201cApple 180\u2033 in two senses. First, to acknowledge the turnabout that will finally allow third-party keyboards on the iPhone, more sharing apps in apps, and a generally deeper integration of apps into iOS than has been possible. Second, to note that with the calendar already well into June, Apple\u2019s product releases will all be complete within the next 180 days as anything that hasn\u2019t been delivered by around Thanksgiving isn\u2019t part of what Cue could reasonably consider \u201cthis year.\u201d The first product worthy of examination in the Apple 180 is the heavily rumored \u201ciWatch,\u201d which most analysts have pegged for a launch around October of this year. Here\u2019s a rundown of what\u2019s expected:", "Apple never comments on unreleased products and its much talked about entry into the smartwatch category is no different. But last year, Cook did weigh in a bit on the idea broadly. Speaking at the\u00a0", "conference, he said, \u201cI think the wrist is interesting. I\u2019m wearing this (Nike Fuelband) on my wrist, it\u2019s somewhat natural.

While the design is elegant, it doesn\u2019t mesh with other rumors that Apple is planning on shipping its smartwatch in two sizes, with displays of 1.3 and 1.5 inches, likely sourced from LG.", "Significantly, the smartwatch product \u2014 which even money says won\u2019t be called the iWatch \u2014 will use OLED displays. Cook has trashed the technology on a couple of occasions, even calling it \u201c", ".\u201d But OLED has been used on a number of great products, including the Samsung Galaxy S5 and\u00a0", "said it has ", ". OLED will be used because it allows for thinness that LCD can\u2019t match as it requires a separate light source. And while both display technologies can be curved, it\u2019s much easier to pull that off with OLED. So don\u2019t be shocked if the display is contoured a bit to conform to the wrist.", " If Apple does ship the product in two sizes, that will mark a significant departure from the way competitors have approached the market to date. Products from Sony, Pebble and others have featured chunky, male-centric designs in a single size. No smartwatch to date could be called female friendly nor especially subtle. Apple\u2019s famous design sensibilities give it a big opportunity to differentiate here.", "As for what you\u2019ll be able to do with the \u201ciWatch,\u201d look first to the burgeoning fitness-tracker market for ideas. Products like the Fitbit have been tracking your steps, miles and stairs climbed for a few years now. While the iPhone 5s can do that, too, expect Apple to double-down based on the announcement of HealthKit at WWDC. To keep the watch slim, it won\u2019t possibly be able to do everything people have discussed: measuring pulse, blood pressure, glucose, oxygen levels, et al. But it\u2019s likely to do at least some of those. And it\u2019s nearly certain to work invisibly in tandem with the iPhone. If you have an app on the phone that tracks activity, it should transparently use whatever data it can, whether that comes from the iWatch or the built-in M7 processor.", "As for what else you might be able to do on such a small screen, think primarily about notifications that come to your phone now. Here, Ewan Spence ", "\u00a0in his\u00a0", "column, but the key takeaway is that iOS 8 allows for interactive notifications. One easy example is when you get a friend request on Facebook on the iPhone, imagine just hitting accept within the small pane atop the screen. Developers were very excited about these interactive notifications at WWDC, so innovation here is very likely. But translating the user experience to the watch won\u2019t be trivial for everything. Visuals will have to be tailored for the screen and some things won\u2019t work on the smaller display.", "Still, there\u2019s an important point here: Everyone believes Apple will open the platform to third-party \u201capps\u201d of some kind, even if those apps are merely companions to something that runs on your iPhone.

In some fundamental ways, Apple has opened up its mobile operating system to more customization and modification than at any time in the prior 7 years. This new philosophy coincides with a yet-to-be-seen product lineup that Apple\u2019s senior vice president Eddy Cue has called ", ". The intersection of the new openness with Apple\u2019s forthcoming devices is the most important shift of the Tim Cook era. It will determine whether Apple is poised to retain its spot as the world\u2019s most valuable company and, in some ways more importantly, its reputation as the leading innovator in the mobile era.", "In the spirt of the company\u2019s proclamations, this space will look at the \u201cApple 180\u2033 in two senses. First, to acknowledge the turnabout that will finally allow third-party keyboards on the iPhone, more sharing apps in apps, and a generally deeper integration of apps into iOS than has been possible. Second, to note that with the calendar already well into June, Apple\u2019s product releases will all be complete within the next 180 days as anything that hasn\u2019t been delivered by around Thanksgiving isn\u2019t part of what Cue could reasonably consider \u201cthis year.\u201d The first product worthy of examination in the Apple 180 is the heavily rumored \u201ciWatch,\u201d which most analysts have pegged for a launch around October of this year. Here\u2019s a rundown of what\u2019s expected:", "Apple never comments on unreleased products and its much talked about entry into the smartwatch category is no different. But last year, Cook did weigh in a bit on the idea broadly. Speaking at the\u00a0", "conference, he said, \u201cI think the wrist is interesting. I\u2019m wearing this (Nike Fuelband) on my wrist, it\u2019s somewhat natural. But as I said before, I think for something to work here, you first have to convince people it\u2019s so incredible that they want to wear it.\u201d Consider the gauntlet thrown.", "Whether Apple is planning something that resembles a traditional watch or more of a wristband like Samsung\u2019s ", " has been the subject of intense speculation. The popular Apple site\u00a0", " of a band-like design some months ago that\u2019s included here. While the design is elegant, it doesn\u2019t mesh with other rumors that Apple is planning on shipping its smartwatch in two sizes, with displays of 1.3 and 1.5 inches, likely sourced from LG.", "Significantly, the smartwatch product \u2014 which even money says won\u2019t be called the iWatch \u2014 will use OLED displays.

OLED will be used because it allows for thinness that LCD can\u2019t match as it requires a separate light source. And while both display technologies can be curved, it\u2019s much easier to pull that off with OLED. So don\u2019t be shocked if the display is contoured a bit to conform to the wrist.", " If Apple does ship the product in two sizes, that will mark a significant departure from the way competitors have approached the market to date. Products from Sony, Pebble and others have featured chunky, male-centric designs in a single size. No smartwatch to date could be called female friendly nor especially subtle. Apple\u2019s famous design sensibilities give it a big opportunity to differentiate here.", "As for what you\u2019ll be able to do with the \u201ciWatch,\u201d look first to the burgeoning fitness-tracker market for ideas. Products like the Fitbit have been tracking your steps, miles and stairs climbed for a few years now. While the iPhone 5s can do that, too, expect Apple to double-down based on the announcement of HealthKit at WWDC. To keep the watch slim, it won\u2019t possibly be able to do everything people have discussed: measuring pulse, blood pressure, glucose, oxygen levels, et al. But it\u2019s likely to do at least some of those. And it\u2019s nearly certain to work invisibly in tandem with the iPhone. If you have an app on the phone that tracks activity, it should transparently use whatever data it can, whether that comes from the iWatch or the built-in M7 processor.", "As for what else you might be able to do on such a small screen, think primarily about notifications that come to your phone now. Here, Ewan Spence ", "\u00a0in his\u00a0", "column, but the key takeaway is that iOS 8 allows for interactive notifications. One easy example is when you get a friend request on Facebook on the iPhone, imagine just hitting accept within the small pane atop the screen. Developers were very excited about these interactive notifications at WWDC, so innovation here is very likely. But translating the user experience to the watch won\u2019t be trivial for everything. Visuals will have to be tailored for the screen and some things won\u2019t work on the smaller display.", "Still, there\u2019s an important point here: Everyone believes Apple will open the platform to third-party \u201capps\u201d of some kind, even if those apps are merely companions to something that runs on your iPhone.

Why the visions of billable hours dancing in their heads? The increasingly stringent worldwide regulations for marketing to children.", "In his Kids and Apps Session, Espinosa, who joined Apple at the kid-like age of 14 and is the company\u2019s longest-serving employee, surveyed this thorny territory with an upbeat cadence reminiscent of Mr. Rogers. Despite the complexities, he explained to the eager developers, Apple has a plan\u2014and it\u2019s a good one. The nut of the COPPA regulations (Children\u2019s Online Privacy Protection Act, circa 2000) concern the conditions under which developers and game companies can target users under the age of 13 with their products (and attendant advertising) and if they can collect any form of persistent data about them.", "Online privacy and marketing to children are important issues, if you bother to think through the implications of what your children may do and be exposed to on their interactive devices, but face it, most parents glaze over about this stuff. The more expedient concern is often appeasing the tykes so we can get back to our email, ESPN ScoreCenter, Pinterest pinboards and fuddy-duddy Facebook feeds.", "This need for speed has created ", " as we realize that our (adult) iTunes accounts have become overrun with Pretty Little Liars, Thomas The Train and A$AP Ferg. You see, in order to sidestep those COPPA regulations and the (very real fear) that Junior will run up in-app purchases on Contract Killer, Apple has not allowed kids under 13 to have their own iTunes accounts. In order to provide a semblance of persistent play, it did allow younger children to have their own identity-free Game Center accounts in iOS, but this did nothing about the mingling of the familial iTunes account.", "The annoyances of this arrangement have grown as Apple has tried to increase the convenience of the user\u2019s experience by synching everything with iCloud. With each software update family members would all of a sudden have access not only to each other\u2019s purchased content and games but also their email and text message accounts. Surveilling your children may be useful at times, but being surveilled ", " them is intolerable!", "And the next set of software developments are bound to make this muddle even worse. Artificial Intelligence (AI) powered recommendation and personalization services are the next big thing after ubiquitous cloud services. The demands of competition with other platforms, notably Google, Facebook and Microsoft and a cohort of nascent startups massing for acquisition by the same, is driving this trend, but so is the wearables market that Apple hopes to dominate with its forthcoming iWatch. Small screens, short timeframes and mobility require that the precise bits of appropriate content be curated with lightening speed.", "Fortunately for Apple, its developers ", " its customers, the new Family Plan it announced at WWDC will mostly solve these problems and be a big win for all concerned. The secret? Allowing kids under 13 to have semi-autonomous iTunes accounts under the management (and credit card) of a parent. By making this management easier than the anarchic alternative, Apple is effectively offloading some of the responsibility for COPPA compliance on to the parents of the children the law is designed to protect. Don\u2019t want Junior to play Gun Bros (or blow $600 on an \u201cApathy Bear?\u201d) Decline the notification from the little rascal!", "The way the Family Plan works is that one parent becomes the administrator of the family account and invites the other family members for a total of up to six people. The linked iTunes accounts need to share the same payment method. Once this is all in place, the children can make purchases\u2014with parental approval\u2014and all family members ", " have access to all of each other\u2019s purchases.", "This potential part is important because the Family Plan sits on top of Apple\u2019s existing parental controls. In this context, if a family member does not have permission to view R-rated movies, for example, these will not even be visible (to that family member) on the list of the parent\u2019s purchases from which the child can choose.", "In practical terms this has three main implications. For the members of the family groups themselves it means the end of the enforced identification of each member with the primary iTunes account. This should make integration of iCloud services easier because automatic syncing will lead to fewer \u201cfalse positives.\u201d It will also make each family member\u2019s iTunes experience more curated since they will not find their devices automatically downloading Hannah Montana episodes.", "The bigger news for app developers, both within Apple and third-party, is that curation and personalization of recommendations are\u00a0", " easier to do when a user\u2019s training data is not contaminated by that of their kid sister or boomer dad. If Apple uses this capability wisely, and makes it available to outside developers, it could net significantly increased purchases per family member. Yes, the mom or dad will get automated alert messages that they will need to respond to when their kids want to make purchases, but the kids are automatically logged into the payment method so, from a management perspective, the approval takes but a single click.", "Here\u2019s where it gets just a little evil. The same pressure to placate the impatient children still exists, but to pass COPPA rules the parent needs to sign off on each purchase. So parents will still find themselves saying \u201cyes\u201d to things they have not properly considered, but now ", " are responsible, not Apple or the manipulative game developer or exploitative content producer. Clever, Apple, very clever!", "The most interesting aspect of this to me culturally is that", " . That\u2019s it! No legal status, no bloodlines, just pure consumerism. I can imagine this seeming disruptive to people who define family in more traditional terms. Gay marriage is still about defining an emotional commitment between people, but the Apple \u201cfamily\u201d is a purely economic construct whose defining characteristic is the clarity of the resulting data and the ease of revenue growth!", "It is easy to see how the Apple Family Plan could play out among groups of roommates or other intentional communities. If the idea takes hold, look for the phone companies and even Amazon Prime to follow suit. The post-modern family has been moving in this direction for years, towards being an economic and cultural interest group, and the spread of mobile devices and cloud services is quickening the pace. Apple has no choice but to try to fix the mess it has made of family\u2019s media collections and personal data, but the solution has cultural implications it may not be anticipating.", "On purely practical terms, I am looking forward to the clarity that the Family Plan will bring to ", " family. I am tired of the patriarchal iTunes account mingling everyone\u2019s content and privacy. Every day I am asked to explain why iTunes is trying to download ", " movie on this person\u2019s laptop or why ", " are showing up on that person\u2019s iPhone. It is patently clear that each person needs their own iTunes account to actually take advantage of iCloud integration. Without that, it\u2019s just a big muddle that delivers more hassle than value. For Apple to deliver on cloud services that will really tie us to Apple\u2014and each other\u2014we need to address each individual uniquely, \u201cno matter how small,\u201d to quote Dr. Seuss.
