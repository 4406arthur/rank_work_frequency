The Chilean tsunami caused death and destruction throughout the Pacific.

Hilo's position in the bay caused a cumulative bounce of tsunami waves far more destructive to Hilo than to other more exposed areas of Hawaii.", " The tsunami destroyed or damaged more than 500 homes and businesses downtown and killed 61 people. 282 people were badly hurt.

Measurements of\rpast tsunamis are commonly used to help\ridentify areas at risk from future tsunamis.\rMeasurements had been made in Hawaii of\rAleutian tsunamis, but little was known\rabout the heights of tsunamis from Chile.\r", "\rIn Hilo, Mr. Eaton and his companions\rstopped to clear their plans with the police\rand then drove to the Wailuku River\rBridge, on the shore of Hilo Bay. They knew that the 1946\rAleutian tsunami had destroyed the bridge\rthere. The men set up an observation post\ron the new bridge and began measuring\rthe water level beneath it. Just in case,\rthey also planned their own evacuation\rroute, a short sprint to high ground.\r", "\rJust after midnight, the water under the\rbridge rose to 4 feet above normal-the\rfirst wave of the tsunami had arrived. At\r12:46 a.m., the second wave washed\runder the bridge at a level 9 feet above\rnormal. By 1:00 a.m., the water beneath\rthe bridge had dropped to 7 feet below\rnormal. Mr. Eaton recalls that they then\rheard an ominous noise, a faint rumble\rlike a distant train, that came from the\rdarkness far out in Hilo Bay. Two minutes\rlater, they began to see the source of the\rnoise, a pale wall of tumbling water,\rcaught in the dim lights of Hilo. The wave\rgrew in height as it moved steadily toward\rthe city, and the noise became deafening.\r", "\rBy 1:04 a.m., the men on the bridge\rrealized that they should run the few\rhundred feet to high ground. Turning\raround, they watched the 20-foot-high,\rnearly vertical front of the wave hit the\rbridge, and water splashed high into the air.\rAfter this wave had passed and they thought\rit was safe, Mr. Eaton and his companions\rreturned to the bridge and continued to\rrecord the water level during several more\rwaves of the tsunami (see diagram below).\r", "\r", "\r", "\r", "\r", "\r", "\r", "\r", "\r", "\rGoing to high ground and staying\rthere helped save lives during the 1960\rChilean tsunami, not only in Chile but\ralso in Onagawa, Japan (", ").\rDamaging waves in Onagawa, some of\rwhich carried battering rams of floating\rwood, reached heights of 14 feet.

The\rhouse, on low ground west of Maull\u00edn,\rwithstood the 1960 earthquake. The house\ralso withstood the first two waves of the\rtsunami that followed the quake, but the\rthird wave swept it away. This wave also\rtoppled a nearby tree that Ms. Cubate\u2019s\rfather had climbed to escape the tsunami.\rBoth he and Ms. Cubate\u2019s mother\rdrowned in the tsunami. Survivors on the\rroof later pulled the mother\u2019s body from\rthe water.\r", "\r", "\r", "\r", "\r", "\r", " (\u201cThe\rtsunami was so big that it even took the\rdead from their graves\u201d). This saying\rcomes from Quenuir, Chile, a village at\rthe mouth of the R\u00edo Maull\u00edn. The tsunami\rthat followed the 1960 Chile earthquake\rkilled 105 people from Quenuir-a\rquarter of the village\u2019s population. In\raddition to this loss of the living, Quenuir\rlost many of its dead. The village cemetery\rwas located on sandy ground that\rthe tsunami washed away. Debris from\rthe cemetery came to rest more than 3\rmiles upriver. There, just outside La\rPasada, Tulio Ruiz found crosses and a\rfull casket.\r", "\rThe 1960 tsunami also deposited sand\ralong the R\u00edo Maull\u00edn, some of it on land\rowned by Juan Vera. He and his wife,\rMar\u00eda Silva, lived on low ground 2 miles\reast of Maull\u00edn. The 1960 earthquake\rfound Mrs. Silva at home and her\rhusband on a nearby hillside. Their house\rcollapsed, but Mrs. Silva escaped and\rsoon joined her husband on high ground.\rTogether they watched the tsunami\roverrun their fields and carry away the\rremains of their house. The next day, Mr.\rVera found a layer of sand several\rinches thick on much of the land the\rtsunami had overrun.\r", "\rMany houses were carried inland by\rthe 1960 tsunami. After fleeing to high\rground near Queule, more than 100 miles\rnorth of Maull\u00edn (", "), Filberto Henr\u00edquez saw\rhouses floating away from the town. He\rrecalls that some of the houses, with their\rstoves still smoking, looked like ships.\rRemains of houses from Queule ended up\ras much as a mile inland (according to a\rreport by Wolfgang Weischet;,\rbut Margarita Liemp\u00ed\u2019s house was\rdeposited intact; even her drinking\rglasses were unbroken.\r", "\rAt Mehu\u00edn, near Queule, Jacinto\rReyes buried some of the tsunami\rvictims. Among them were the parents of\rtwo girls who were found in blackberry\rbushes, scratched but alive.

The pines, grown for\rtimber, covered low ground around Mr.\rAtala\u2019s barn. During the\rearthquake, this land was lowered.\rBecause tides were then able to inundate\rthe plantation, the ground became too wet\rand salty for the trees to survive.\r", "\rWhat happened to Mr. Atala\u2019s plantation\rhappened at many places along\rChile\u2019s coast. When a 600-mile-long\rstretch of the South American tectonic\rplate was thinned during the 1960\rearthquake, nearby land was lowered as\rmuch as 8 feet.
