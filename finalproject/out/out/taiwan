This drop significantly reduced the prosperity of aboriginal tribes (", ":303), forcing many aborigines to take up farming to counter the economic impact of losing their most vital food source.", "As the Dutch began subjugating aboriginal villages in the south and west of Taiwan, increasing numbers of Han immigrants looked to exploit areas that were fertile and rich in game. The Dutch initially encouraged this, since the Han were skilled in agriculture and large-scale hunting. Several Han took up residence in Siraya villages. The Dutch used Han agents to collect taxes, hunting license fees and other income. This set up a society in which \"many of the colonists were ", " but the military and the administrative structures were Dutch\" (", ":298). Despite this, local alliances transcended ethnicity during the Dutch period.

Moreover, the acculturation of aborigines in increased numbers may have intensified the perception of a swell in the number of Han.", "The Qing government officially sanctioned controlled Han settlement, but sought to manage tensions between the various regional and ethnic groups.

The Plains tribes were often cheated out of land or pressured to sell at unfavorable rates. Some disaffected subgroups moved to central or eastern Taiwan, but most remained in their ancestral locations and acculturated or assimilated into Han society (", ").", "One popular narrative holds that all of the Gaoshan tribes were originally Plains tribes, which fled to the mountains under pressure from Han encroachment. This strong version of the \"migration\" theory has been largely discounted by contemporary research as the Gaoshan people demonstrate a physiology, material cultures and customs that have been adapted for life at higher elevations. Linguistic, archaeological, and recorded anecdotal evidence also suggests there has been island-wide migration of indigenous peoples for over 3,000 years.", "Small sub-groups of ", " may have occasionally fled to the mountains, foothills or eastern plain to escape hostile groups of Han or other aborigines (see ", ":1\u201310; ", ").

Each migration consisted of a number of families and totaled hundreds of people, not entire tribes (", ":391\u201395; ", ":36\u20137).

The lack of data before this was primarily the result of a Qing quarantine on the region to the east of the \"earth oxen\" (\u571f\u725b) border, which ran along the eastern edge of the western plain. Han contact with the mountain tribes was usually associated with the enterprise of gathering and extracting ", " from Camphor Laurel trees (", "), native to the island and in particular the mountainous areas. The production and shipment of camphor (used in herbal medicines and mothballs) was then a significant industry on the island, lasting up to and including the period of Japanese rule (", ":220\u201324.). These early encounters often involved headhunting parties from the Highland tribes, who sought out and raided unprotected Han forest workers.

The aborigines traded cloth, pelts and meat for iron and matchlock rifles. Iron was a necessary material for the fabrication of hunting knives\u2014long, curved sabers that were generally used as a forest tool. These blades became notorious among Han settlers, given their alternative use to decapitate Highland tribal enemies in customary headhunting expeditions.", "The Highland tribes were renowned for their skill in ", ", which was a symbol of bravery and valor (", ":29\u201336). Almost every tribe except the Yami (Tao) practiced headhunting. Once the victims had been dispatched the heads were taken then boiled and left to dry, often hanging from trees or shelves constructed for the purpose. A party returning with a head was cause for celebration, as it would bring good luck. The Bunun people would often take prisoners and inscribe prayers or messages to their dead on arrows, then shoot their prisoner with the hope their prayers would be carried to the dead. Han settlers were often the victims of headhunting raids as they were considered by the aborigines to be liars and enemies. A headhunting raid would often strike at workers in the fields, or employ the ruse of setting a dwelling alight and then decapitating the inhabitants as they fled the burning structure. It was also customary to later raise the victim's surviving children as full members of the tribe. Often the heads themselves were ceremonially 'invited' to join the tribe as members, where they were supposed to watch over the tribe and keep them safe. The indigenous inhabitants of Taiwan accepted the convention and practice of headhunting as one of the calculated risks of tribal life. The last groups to practice headhunting were the Paiwan, Bunun, and Atayal groups (", "). Japanese rule ended the practice by 1930, but some elder Taiwanese can recall the practice ", ".", "When the ", " was finalized on April 17, 1895, Taiwan was ceded by the Qing Empire to Japan (", ":36). Taiwan's incorporation into the Japanese political orbit brought Taiwanese aborigines into contact with a new colonial structure, determined to define and locate indigenous people within the framework of a new, multi-ethnic empire (", ":19). The means of accomplishing this goal took three main forms: anthropological study of the natives of Taiwan, attempts to reshape the aborigines in the mould of the Japanese, and military suppression.", "Japan's sentiment regarding indigenous peoples was crafted around the memory of the ", ", when, in 1871, a group of shipwrecked Okinawan fishermen was massacred by a Paiwan group from the village of Mudan in southern Taiwan. The resulting Japanese policy, published twenty years before the onset of their rule on Taiwan, cast Taiwanese aborigines as \"vicious, violent and cruel\" and concluded \"this is a pitfall of the world; we must get rid of them all\" (", ":20\u20131). Japanese campaigns to gain aboriginal submission were often brutal, as evidenced in the desire of Japan's first Governor General, ", ", to \"...conquer the barbarians\" (", ":20). In the ", " of 1930, for example, a Seediq group was decimated by artillery and supplanted by the Taroko (Truku) tribe, which had sustained periods of bombardment from naval ships and airplanes dropping mustard gas. A quarantine was placed around the mountain areas enforced by armed guard stations and electrified fence until the most remote high mountain villages could be relocated closer to administrative control (", ":210\u201319).", "Beginning in the first year of Japanese rule, the colonial government embarked on a mission to study the aborigines so they could be classified, located and \"civilized\". The Japanese \"civilizing project\", partially fueled by public demand in Japan to know more about the empire, would be used to benefit the Imperial government by consolidating administrative control over the entire island, opening up vast tracts of land for exploitation (", ":1\u20138). To satisfy these needs, \"the Japanese portrayed and catalogued Taiwan's indigenous peoples in a welter of statistical tables, magazine and newspaper articles, photograph albums for popular consumption\" (", ":181). The Japanese based much of their information and terminology on prior Qing era narratives concerning degrees of \"civilization\" (", ":27\u201330).", "Japanese ethnographer Ino Kanari was charged with the task of surveying the entire population of Taiwanese aborigines, applying the first systematic study of aborigines on Taiwan.

This is the direct antecedent of the taxonomy used today to distinguish tribes that are officially recognized by the government.", "Tribal life under the Japanese changed rapidly as many of the traditional structures were replaced by a military power. Aborigines who wished to improve their status looked to education rather than headhunting as the new form of power. Those who learned to work with the Japanese and follow their customs would be better suited to lead villages. The Japanese encouraged aborigines to maintain traditional costumes and selected customs that were not considered detrimental to society, but invested much time and money in efforts to eliminate traditions deemed unsavory by Japanese culture, including tattooing (", "). By the mid-1930s as Japan's empire was reaching its zenith, the colonial government began a political socialization program designed to enforce Japanese customs, rituals and a loyal Japanese identity upon the aborigines. By the end of World War II, aborigines whose fathers had been killed in pacification campaigns were volunteering to die for the Emperor of Japan (", ":153\u201373).

In 1951 a major political socialization campaign was launched to change the lifestyle of many aborigines, to adopt Han Chinese customs. A 1953 government report on mountain areas stated that its aims were chiefly to promote Mandarin in order to strengthen a national outlook and create good customs. This was included in the Shandi Pingdi Hua (\u5c71\u5730\u5e73\u5730\u5316) policy to \"make the mountains like the plains\" (", ":351).

Modern studies show a high degree of genetic intermixing. Despite this, many contemporary Taiwanese are unwilling to entertain the idea of having an aboriginal heritage. In a 1994 study, it was found that 71% of the families surveyed would object to their daughter marrying an aboriginal man. For much of the KMT era, the official government definition of aboriginal identity had been 100% aboriginal parentage, leaving any intermarriage resulting in a non-aboriginal child. Later the policy was adjusted to the ethnic status of the father determining the status of the child (", ").", "Authoritarian rule under the Kuomintang ended gradually through a transition to democracy, which was marked by the lifting of martial law in 1987. Soon after, the KMT transitioned to being merely one party within a democratic system, though maintaining a high degree of power in aboriginal districts through an established system of patronage networks (", ":400\u201310). The KMT continued to hold the reins of power for another decade under President ", ". However, they did so as an elected government rather than a dictatorial power. The elected KMT government supported many of the bills that had been promoted by aboriginal groups.

Jobs teaching other languages (mainly European or Japanese) do exist but have a much smaller proportion of the market.\n", " - in finding employment with a language school, experience, teaching qualifications and references are not required but obviously help.  On paper, a big issue is also made about accents, with the North American English accent being heavily favored over British, Australian and South African accents in many language schools' sales marketing.  However, in practice, many schools that advertise 'American English' and claim that their teachers are all from Canada or the USA, actually employ teachers from anywhere.  Age is a factor, with applicants in their 20s seemingly being preferred.  More than anything, appearance is probably the major factor in finding employment with most schools - Do you 'look Western'? - and reliability and turning up on time for work is then the major factor for keeping your job.  Therefore, if you look the part, it is very easy to find a school willing to take you on for at least a few days.\n", "This 'look Western' point has quite a bearing.  Unfortunately, Taiwan is hardly a great promoter of ", ".  In many schools there is a prejudice against teachers applying for jobs who are not of white Caucasian appearance, seen as the typical Western appearance in Asian countries.  This is independent of whether or not the teacher has relevant teaching ability and citizenship of one of the permitted ARC countries.  Many parents who send their children to schools to be taught English expect the teacher to look like they are from the U.S., Canada, the UK, Australia, and so on, and so the decision on the part of the school managers is mainly about economics.  For those affected by this, it's a sad fact of Taiwan that is unlikely to change in the near future.  Good employers without such prejudiced requirements do exist, but greater perseverance is needed when looking for them.\n", "It is illegal to work without a ", " and an ARC (or Alien Residency Permit), and legal work officially requires a university degree and usually a long (two month+) application process.  However, illegal employment is easy to find with many school managers being willing to pay under the table for short durations.  Be aware that if caught or reported, you risk criminal charges and could be deported.  The government tends to waver from being very lax on this issue under one administration to suddenly taking action under the next; but remember that it only takes one disgruntled student to report you and have you fined and deported. Consider your options carefully!\n", "The ", " do change often and each administrative part of Taiwan has its own ways of handling them, so it is best to check the pages of the website Forumosa ", " and find out what the experiences of others are in your area.  Keep in mind, that you can only get an ARC for English teaching if you are a 'citizen of a native English speaking country'.  Taiwan's government defines these countries to be only the U.S., Canada, the UK, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland and South Africa.  Almost all teachers apply for an ARC through their employers only after starting work and it is tied to their ongoing employment with that school.  Therefore, if the teacher wishes to leave their employment, they will have to quickly find an alternative employer or lose their ARC and hence be required to leave Taiwan.  Also, very few schools will arrange an ARC without at least a year-long contract being signed.  Frankly, with all this inflexibility, it's no wonder so many teachers opt for the non-legal route.  That and tax evasion.\n", "British and German citizens aged 18-30 can apply for a ", ". For more information, visit the ", ".\n", "A lot of the illegal teaching work that the majority of English teachers partake in is simply through ", " tuition with payment being cash-in-hand.  You can find a lot of private students around universities that have a Chinese-teaching department - look for the areas where all the foreign students will be and check the noticeboards.  Because the majority of adult private students want to practise English conversation, you won't need to have any Chinese ability.  However, it is definitely a selling point and, if you do have Chinese-speaking ability, it's worthwhile mentioning that in any advertising of your services.  Also, once you have some regular students, remember that in Taiwan, as in most Asian countries, 'connections' or 'guanxi' are very important - if your students like you, they will in all likelihood recommend you to their family and friends. \n", "Teaching English in Taiwan can be lucrative, as the ", " are very high compared to the cost of living, typically ranging $500-650 per hour before deductions in most language schools, with anything between $500-1000 per hour being negotiable for private students.  In the past few years, the flow of would-be teachers into Taiwan has increased dramatically, resulting in stiffer competition for jobs as well as a general drop in wages and this trend may continue. On top of this, the Taiwanese dollar has been sliding in value over the past five years, meaning you get less and less for your dollar in foreign currency at the end of the month. It is still possible to save money however, and it's a popular option for recent university graduates. At ", " you can see a monthly financial breakdown of income vs. cost of living for new English teachers in Taiwan.\n", "Aside from English-teaching, ", " available for mainly native English-speaking travellers include such tid-bits as small acting parts for TV and film, voice talent (video games, dubbing tracks, etc), editing and even writing educational materials.  Many of these will be advertised on billboards in Chinese language-teaching institutes and universities, where there are likely to be many foreign students. \n", "If after travelling and living there, you find you are ", ", the most lucrative employment to be had is if you are employed by a multinational company, perhaps in a high-paying country like the UK, U.S. or Australia, and you are sent across to their office in Taiwan.  Many foreigners end up doing the same job as their colleagues who were employed in the Taiwan office, but for perhaps 3 or 4 times their pay.\n", "Taiwan is very safe for tourists, even for women at night. This is not to say, however, that there is no crime, and you should always exercise caution. In crowded areas such as night markets or festivals, for example, ", " are a known problem. However, it is fair to say that the streets of Taiwan are generally very safe and that violent crime and muggings are very rare. \n", "In addition, it is also very unusual to see drunks on the street, day or night.  \n", "Like anywhere else in the world, women should be cautious when taking taxis alone late at night. Although they are generally safe, it's a good idea to arrange to have a friend call you when you get home and to be seen making the arrangements for this by the cab driver. It also helps if a friend sees you being picked up as taxis have visible license numbers. As an additional safety precaution, tell taxi drivers just the street name and section instead of your exact address. \n", "Police departments in most jurisdictions have a Foreign Affairs Police unit staffed by English speaking officers. When reporting a major crime, it is advisable to contact the Foreign Affairs unit in addition to officers at the local precinct.

Heavy monsoon rainfall also occurs during the summer. Hikers and mountaineers should be sure to consult weather reports before heading into the mountains. A major hazard following heavy rainfall in the mountains is falling rocks (\u571f\u77f3\u6d41) caused by the softening of the earth and there are occasional reports of people being killed or injured by these. \n", "Taiwan is also located on the Pacific Ring of Fire, which means that ", " are a common occurrence.

Precautions against snake bites include making plenty of noise as you hike, wearing long trousers and avoiding overgrown trails. Most snakes are scared of humans, so if you make noise you will give them time to get away. Walking quietly means that you may suddenly startle them around a corner when you appear, and trigger an attack. The Russel's viper, one of the most dangerous snakes in Taiwan, is an exception...it generally prefers to take a stand against threats.\n", "Local drivers have a well-deserved reputation for being reckless. It is possible to obtain a driving license in Taiwan without ever having driven on the roads. Despite traffic's chaotic appearance, it is viscerally intuitive to yield the right-of-way to a much larger vehicle barreling towards you. It is advisable to use slow and smooth movements over quick or sudden ones. Local drivers often cut in front of moving traffic into spaces that seem too small, or try to change lanes regardless of the fact that lane is already full, etc.  Be aware that sometimes drivers make two-lane roads become three-lane ones. Drivers routinely enter a junction when their exit is blocked, and are therefore frequently still there long after the lights change, blocking traffic traveling in other directions. Some scooter drivers also zip through tiny spaces. \n", "If you happen to drive a car or a motorcycle, the obvious rule is that if someone turns in front of you, you should be the one to adapt.  To avoid collisions, drivers need to be extremely vigilant for other vehicles creating hazards and always be willing to adjust speed or direction to accommodate.  Do not expect drivers to yield way, or respect traffic lights in many areas, especially in central and southern Taiwan.  Sounding the horn is the usual way a Taiwanese driver indicates that they do not intend to accommodate a driver trying to encroach on their lane, etc, and does not necessarily imply the anger or criticism, as it does in other countries.  One bright side of Taiwan's chaotic traffic is that drivers tend to have an exceptional awareness of the spatial extents of their vehicle, so that even though it continuously looks like somebody is about to drive straight into you, it's relatively rare that they actually do so.\n", "Be extra careful when crossing the road, even to the extent of looking both ways on a one-way street.  When crossing at a pedestrian-crossing at a T-junction or crossroads, be aware that when the little green man lights up and you start crossing, motorists will still try to turn right, with or without a green feeder light.  Even on roads where traffic is infrequent and the green light is in your favor, bike-riders are still strongly advised to check the opposite lane.\n", "Westerners should be cautious of relatively undercooked food.  Many Taiwanese restaurants offer plates of raw, sliced red meat and uncooked seafood that are brought to the table and either barbecued or simmered in a pot of stock.  As this constitutes a staple of the Taiwanese diet, any bacteria that may remain doesn't affect the locals, but it can wreak havoc with foreigners.  The best policy is to make sure you cook the food in a manner to which you are accustomed.\n", "Don't drink tap water without boiling it, though it's safe for brushing your teeth.\n", "Medicines are available for minor ailments at drug stores.  You may also find common drugs requiring a prescription in the west (like asthma inhalers and birth control pills) cheaply available from drug stores without a prescription.\n", "Taiwan has both Chinese physicians and Western doctors, both of which are taken equally seriously. However, as a foreigner, the assumption would generally be to direct you to a Western doctor. The quality of the hospitals in Taiwan is excellent and on par, if not better, with those found in the West. Taiwan's health care program is considered as one of the best health care in the world. Legal residents with a National Health Card can avail themselves of the very convenient and efficient national health service, which covers treatment and medication using both Western and traditional Chinese medicine. However, this service is not available to short term visitors on tourist visas; nor does it cover major hospitalization expenses. Still, hospital visits and medicine in Taiwan tends to be far less expensive than in the west. For minor ailments and problems (flu, broken bones, stitches, etc).  Note that outside the major cities, it might be difficult to find a doctor who speaks English, so try to learn some basic Mandarin before heading off the beaten track.\n", "Watch out for mosquito bites when hiking in the mountains. Especially in the summer, the humid and hot weather makes mosquitos very active. Most mosquito bites only cause skin irritation and itching, but in some areas of Taiwan it's possible to contract Dengue Fever or Japanese Encephalitis (though they are both on the rare side in Taiwan). Mosquito/insect repellent spray can be found at convenience stores (such as 7-11 and Family Mart) and local pharmacies. If you are bitten by mosquitos, apply a small amount of ointment for irritation relief.\n", "Taiwan shares several cultural taboos with other East Asian nations. \n", "Taiwanese society is rather polarized by allegiance between supporters of the two major political blocks informally known as \"Pan-Blue Coalition\" and \"Pan-Green Coalition\", although there are large numbers of people who are either centrist or who don't care. To simplify a very complex situation, pan-blue supporters tend to be more favorable toward the idea of (re)unification or maintaining a status-quo with China and pan-green supporters tend to be more favorable toward the idea of establishing a formally independent Republic of Taiwan, among other differences.\n", "Although there are some correlations, it is highly unwise to assume anything about a particular persons political beliefs based on what you think you know about their background. Also, the very brief sketch of Taiwanese politics obscures a large amount of complexity.\n", "Unless you know your listener well, it is unwise to say anything (either positive or negative) about the current government, about historical figures in Taiwanese history, about Taiwan's international relations, or about relations with mainland China. Some political figures such as Sun Yat-sen and Chiang Ching-kuo are generally seen positively, but others (Chiang Kai-shek, Lee Teng-hui and Chen Shui-bian in particular) arouse very polarized feelings.\n", "Some Taiwanese will get very offended if you imply that Taiwan is part of China. Others will get very offended if you imply that Taiwan is not part of China. Referring to the PRC as \"mainland China\" (\u4e2d\u570b\u5927\u9678 ", ")  rather than simply China will tend not to offend anyone as the term is generally used to exclude Hong Kong and Macau as well, making it less subjective. Referring to the Republic of China as a whole as \"Taiwan Province\" will draw a negative reaction from most Taiwanese. \"Greater China\" may be used in certain business contexts. Keep in mind however, that there are so many subtleties and complexities here that if you are talking about these things, you've already wandered into a minefield. \n", "However, simply referring to the island as 'Taiwan' is fine, as that is the name used by the locals, regardless of their political persuasion. Titles such as 'Republic of China' are reserved for official matters only.\n", "Taiwan is quite liberal when it comes to homosexuality compared to its neighbours. Taiwan does not have laws against homosexuality, though same-sex marriages and unions are currently not recognised. Violence against gays and lesbians rarely occurs. That being said, Taiwan still has some fairly strong male machismo streaks in its society and homosexuality is not quite as open and accepted as in the West or even some other Asian countries like Thailand, and openly displaying your sexuality in public might draw some stares and whispers, especially outside Taipei. But the trend seems to be to be more accepting of it as exampled by gay oriented bars/pubs as well as the many entertainers who are known to be gay as well as a transsexual with her own TV show.\n", "Gays and lesbians may wish to attend the annual ", " parade event (which started around 2003).  This event takes place sometime between September and November, and has become the biggest Pride Parade in Asia throughout the years.\n", "Internet cafes are plentiful, although you may have to wander around before finding one. Rather, Internet cafes in Taiwan should be called gaming cafes. These are often found on the first or second floor of a building, and equipped with very comfortable chairs and large screens. Although people do surf the Internet, most people primarly go there for a smooth experience of online gaming. Each hour of Internet access/game play is cheap, coming in at around $20. Some machines in the internet cafes are coin operated. For free internet access in big cities, try out the local libraries. \n", "The government of Taiwan offers nationwide free WiFi service named iTaiwan ", ", and the City of Taipei offers free WiFi service in many public locations and some of city buses called TPE-Free ", ".
