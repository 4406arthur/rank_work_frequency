I now have a volume icon in the tray and the volume hot keyworks. However the volume is not synced with chromeos like the brightness is!',
             u'Example: I can have the volume in chrome os at 10% and the volume in gnome at 10%. In gnome I increase the volume to 100%. Back in chromeos the volume is still at 10% so to really hear it you have to flip back into chromeos and increase the volume there. The only way volume works good is if you put it at 100%in chromeos and them manage it in gnome.',

             u"Also, the synchronization is not perfect (Chromium OS needs to read back the volume value before modifying it: If you set 50% in Chromium OS, go to crouton, set it to 100%, then got back to Chromium OS and press volume down, you'll get 46%, not 96% as expected), but that needs to be fixed upstream..."],
