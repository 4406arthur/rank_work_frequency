Almost every tribe except the Yami (Tao) practiced headhunting. Once the victims had been dispatched the heads were taken then boiled and left to dry, often hanging from trees or shelves constructed for the purpose. A party returning with a head was cause for celebration, as it would bring good luck. The Bunun people would often take prisoners and inscribe prayers or messages to their dead on arrows, then shoot their prisoner with the hope their prayers would be carried to the dead. Han settlers were often the victims of headhunting raids as they were considered by the aborigines to be liars and enemies. A headhunting raid would often strike at workers in the fields, or employ the ruse of setting a dwelling alight and then decapitating the inhabitants as they fled the burning structure. It was also customary to later raise the victim's surviving children as full members of the tribe. Often the heads themselves were ceremonially 'invited' to join the tribe as members, where they were supposed to watch over the tribe and keep them safe.

Aborigines who wished to improve their status looked to education rather than headhunting as the new form of power. Those who learned to work with the Japanese and follow their customs would be better suited to lead villages.

By the mid-1930s as Japan's empire was reaching its zenith, the colonial government began a political socialization program designed to enforce Japanese customs, rituals and a loyal Japanese identity upon the aborigines.

The Japanese colonial experience left an indelible mark on many older aborigines who maintained an admiration for the Japanese long after their departure in 1945 (", ":54\u20135).", "Japanese rule of Taiwan ended in 1945, following the ", " on September 2 and the subsequent appropriation of the island by Chinese Nationalist Party (", ", or KMT) on October 25. In 1949, on losing the ", " to the ", ", Generalissimo ", " led the Kuomintang in a retreat from ", ", withdrawing its government and 1.3 million refugees to Taiwan. The KMT installed an authoritarian form of government, and shortly thereafter inaugurated a number of political socialization programs aimed at nationalizing Taiwanese people as citizens of a Chinese nation and eradicating Japanese influence (", "). The KMT pursued highly centralized political and cultural policies rooted in the party's decades-long history of fighting ", " in China and opposing competing concepts of a loose federation following the demise of the imperial Qing (", "). The project was designed to create a strong national Chinese ", " (as defined by the state) at the expense of local cultures (", ":47\u20138;140\u201341). Following the ", ", the Kuomintang placed Taiwan under ", ", which was to last for nearly four decades.", "Taiwanese aborigines first encountered the Nationalist government in 1946, when the Japanese village schools were replaced by schools of the KMT. Documents from the Education Office show an emphasis on ", ", ", " and citizenship \u2014 with a curriculum steeped in pro-KMT ", ". Some elements of the curriculum, such as the ", ", are currently considered offensive to aborigines (", "). Much of the burden of educating the aborigines was undertaken by unqualified teachers, who could, at best, speak ", " and teach basic ideology (", ":68\u201370). In 1951 a major political socialization campaign was launched to change the lifestyle of many aborigines, to adopt Han Chinese customs. A 1953 government report on mountain areas stated that its aims were chiefly to promote Mandarin in order to strengthen a national outlook and create good customs. This was included in the Shandi Pingdi Hua (\u5c71\u5730\u5e73\u5730\u5316) policy to \"make the mountains like the plains\" (", ":351). Critics of the KMT's program for a centralized national culture regard it as institutionalized ethnic discrimination, and point to the loss of several indigenous languages and a perpetuation of shame for being an aborigine", " as the direct result of what has been referred to as ", ".", "The pattern of intermarriage continued, as many KMT soldiers married aboriginal women who were from poorer areas and could be easily bought as wives (", ":351). Modern studies show a high degree of genetic intermixing. Despite this, many contemporary Taiwanese are unwilling to entertain the idea of having an aboriginal heritage. In a 1994 study, it was found that 71% of the families surveyed would object to their daughter marrying an aboriginal man. For much of the KMT era, the official government definition of aboriginal identity had been 100% aboriginal parentage, leaving any intermarriage resulting in a non-aboriginal child. Later the policy was adjusted to the ethnic status of the father determining the status of the child (", ").", "Authoritarian rule under the Kuomintang ended gradually through a transition to democracy, which was marked by the lifting of martial law in 1987. Soon after, the KMT transitioned to being merely one party within a democratic system, though maintaining a high degree of power in aboriginal districts through an established system of patronage networks (", ":400\u201310). The KMT continued to hold the reins of power for another decade under President ", ". However, they did so as an elected government rather than a dictatorial power. The elected KMT government supported many of the bills that had been promoted by aboriginal groups. The tenth amendment to the ", " also stipulates that the government would protect and preserve aborigine culture and languages and also encourage them to participate in politics.", "During the period of political liberalization, which preceded the end of martial law, academic interest in the Plains aborigines surged as amateur and professional historians sought to rediscover Taiwan's past. The opposition ", " activists seized upon the new image of the Plains aborigines as a means to directly challenge the KMT's official narrative of Taiwan as a historical part of China, and the government's assertion that Taiwanese were \"pure\" Han Chinese (", ":170; ", ":23\u20139). Many ", " activists framed the Plains aboriginal experience in the existing anti-colonialism/victimization Taiwanese nationalist narrative, which positioned the ", " speaking Taiwanese in the role of indigenous people and the victims of successive foreign rulers (", ":171\u201373; ", ":32\u201342; ", "). By the late 1980s many Hoklo and ", " speaking people began identifying themselves as Plains aborigines, though any initial shift in ethnic consciousness from ", " or ", " was minor. Despite the politicized dramatization of the Plains aborigines, their \"rediscovery\" as a matter of public discourse has had a lasting effect on the increased socio-political reconceptualization of Taiwan\u2014emerging from the a Han Chinese dominant perspective into a wider acceptance of Taiwan as a multi-cultural and multi-ethnic community (", ":171).", "In many districts Taiwanese aborigines tend to vote for the ", ", to the point that the legislative seats allocated to the aborigines are popularly described as ", " for the ", ". This may seem surprising in light of the focus of the ", " on promoting aboriginal culture as part of the Taiwanese nationalist discourse against the KMT. However, this voting pattern can be explained on economic grounds, and as part of an inter-ethnic power struggle waged in the electorate. Some aborigines see the rhetoric of Taiwan nationalism as favoring the majority Hoklo speakers rather than themselves. Aboriginal areas also tend to be poor and their economic vitality tied to the entrenched patronage networks established by the Kuomintang over the course of its fifty-five year reign. (", ":401\u201310; ", "; ", ")", "The democratic era is a time of great change, both constructive and destructive, for the aborigines of Taiwan. Since the 1980s, increased political and public attention has been paid to the rights and social issues of the indigenous tribes of Taiwan.

They often lacked satisfactory educational resources on their reservations, undermining their pursuit of marketable skills. The economic disparity between the village and urban schools resulted in imposing many social barriers on aborigines, which prevent many from moving beyond vocational training. Students transplanted into urban schools face adversity, including isolation, culture shock, and discrimination from their peers (", ":8\u201313).

Manufacturing and construction jobs were generally available for low wages. The aborigines quickly formed bonds with other tribes as they all had similar political motives to protect their collective needs as part of the labor force. The aborigines became the most skilled iron-workers and construction teams on the island often selected to work on the most difficult projects. The result was a mass exodus of tribal members from their traditional lands and the cultural alienation of young people in the villages, who could not learn their languages or customs while employed. Often, young aborigines in the cities fell into gangs aligned with the construction trade. Recent laws governing the employment of laborers from Indonesia, Vietnam and the Philippines has led to an increased atmosphere among urban aborigines of xenophobia and encouraged the formulation of a pan-indigenous consciousness in the pursuit of political representation and protection (", ":167\u201369).", "Of the current population of Taiwanese aborigines, about 70% identify themselves as ", ".

On paper, a big issue is also made about accents, with the North American English accent being heavily favored over British, Australian and South African accents in many language schools' sales marketing.  However, in practice, many schools that advertise 'American English' and claim that their teachers are all from Canada or the USA, actually employ teachers from anywhere.  Age is a factor, with applicants in their 20s seemingly being preferred.  More than anything, appearance is probably the major factor in finding employment with most schools - Do you 'look Western'? - and reliability and turning up on time for work is then the major factor for keeping your job.

Almost all teachers apply for an ARC through their employers only after starting work and it is tied to their ongoing employment with that school.  Therefore, if the teacher wishes to leave their employment, they will have to quickly find an alternative employer or lose their ARC and hence be required to leave Taiwan.

Taiwan does not have laws against homosexuality, though same-sex marriages and unions are currently not recognised. Violence against gays and lesbians rarely occurs. That being said, Taiwan still has some fairly strong male machismo streaks in its society and homosexuality is not quite as open and accepted as in the West or even some other Asian countries like Thailand, and openly displaying your sexuality in public might draw some stares and whispers, especially outside Taipei. But the trend seems to be to be more accepting of it as exampled by gay oriented bars/pubs as well as the many entertainers who are known to be gay as well as a transsexual with her own TV show.\n", "Gays and lesbians may wish to attend the annual ", " parade event (which started around 2003).  This event takes place sometime between September and November, and has become the biggest Pride Parade in Asia throughout the years.\n", "Internet cafes are plentiful, although you may have to wander around before finding one. Rather, Internet cafes in Taiwan should be called gaming cafes. These are often found on the first or second floor of a building, and equipped with very comfortable chairs and large screens. Although people do surf the Internet, most people primarly go there for a smooth experience of online gaming. Each hour of Internet access/game play is cheap, coming in at around $20. Some machines in the internet cafes are coin operated. For free internet access in big cities, try out the local libraries. \n", "The government of Taiwan offers nationwide free WiFi service named iTaiwan ", ", and the City of Taipei offers free WiFi service in many public locations and some of city buses called TPE-Free ", ".
