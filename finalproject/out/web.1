             u'Girl Scouting in the United States of America began on March 12, 1912 when ',

             u' Low, who had met ',
             u' in London while she was living in the United Kingdom, dreamed of giving the United States and the world "something for all the girls". She envisioned an organization that would bring girls out of their homes to serve their communities, experience the out-of-doors, and have the opportunity to develop "self-reliance and resourcefulness". From its inception, the Girl Scouts has been organized and run exclusively by women, for girls and women.',
             u'In late 1912, Low proposed that the ',
             u' merge with the Girl Guides, but was rejected in January 1913 as Camp Fire was then the larger group. Next, Low attempted to merge her organization with the ',

             u". She thought their similarities would make this easier but Lisetor-Lane felt Daisy copycatted her organization and threatened to sue. Lisetor-Lane later claimed Low's organization was luring members away but the GSA's growth was limited by a lack of financial resources which led to its eventual demise.",
             u'The Girl Guides of America in 1913 changed its name to the Girl Scouts of the United States and moved its headquarters to ',

             u'The GSUSA started with 18 members. Within months, members were hiking through the woods in knee-length blue uniforms, playing basketball on a curtained-off court, and going on camping trips. In 1916, Low established an aviation badge\u2014even before women could vote. By 1920, there were nearly 70,000 members.',
             u' By 1923 the organization had branches in every state in the union, Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico and a total membership of 125,738.',
             u' In 1930 it had over 200,000. In 2013 there were over 3.2\xa0million Girl Scouts: 2.3 million girl members and 890,000 adult members in the United States.',

             u'The names and ages of the ',

             u' Troops were initially fairly independent before joining together into small councils, which have recently merged into larger councils. Today there are over 100 councils across the U.S.',

             u'Most Girl Scout units were originally ',

             u'. She also fully desegregated the Cumberland Valley council in 1962.',
             u' The first official African-American troop in the South was founded in 1932 in ',

             u' Later the same year, ',

             u'The ',
             u' program was a Senior Girl Scout program for girls interested in flying and wanting to serve their country that started in 1941 and ended in the 1970s. In July 1942, 29 troop leaders from 15 states met in ',
             u', Pennsylvania to take Wing Scout leadership training. They returned to their councils and began setting up Wing Scout troops. In 1959, the Girl Scout Council in North ',
             u', California was presented with an offer from ',
             u" San Francisco Management Club President J. L. Burnside to start an aviation program for Senior Girl Scouts. One of the highlights of the Wing Scout program was the courtesy flight provided to Senior Girl Scouts using United Airlines' jets. For many of the girls, this was the first time they had flown in a ",
             u'. Senior Girl Scouts who had been in the program for three years were given the opportunity to take over the controls during flight in a small aircraft. The program was discontinued after ',
             u' experienced financial setbacks in the 1970s.',
             u'The program was originally for girls aged 10 to 18, but it was subsequently divided into three levels. ',
             u' (for younger girls) was based on a program developed in England in 1914 and was officially recognized in the mid-1920s. At the same time, girls over 18, or over 16 if First Class Scouts, became known as Senior Scouts. In 1938, the age divisions were: Brownies (ages 7 through 9), Intermediates (ages 10 through 13), and Seniors (ages 14 through 18).',
             u'In 1965 the age structure was rearranged to Brownies (ages 7 through 9, later 6 through 9), Juniors (ages 9 through 11), Cadettes (ages 11 through 14), and Seniors (ages 14 through 17).',
             u' In 1984, the ',
             u' program for ',
             u' girls or those aged five was introduced.',
             u'In 2003, the ',
             u' program for girls aged 11 to 17 was introduced through Cadettes and Seniors.',
             u' Studio 2B allowed girls to call themselves by any name of their choosing, including but not limited to "Studio 2Bs,"',
             u' "teen Girl Scouts," or Cadettes and Seniors. Girl Scouts, aged 11 through 17, can earn both traditional badges and undertake Studio 2B activities, and the Silver Award and Gold Award requirements were rewritten to require both. Studio 2B activities differed from badges in two ways: each booklet focused on topics such as environmentalism or self-confidence rather than being; and to earn each Studio 2B charm, the Girl Scout had to choose activities from the booklet and then meet a goal relevant to the booklet topic. She would create her own plan for achieving her goal, following a basic planning procedure called ',
             u' (standing for Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, Timely).',
             u'On October 1, 2008, all levels were changed to have Girl Scouts as the beginning of their name, e.g. "Girl Scout Brownies" instead of "Brownie Girl Scouts", and all levels are by grade only instead of by age or grade. A new level, Girl Scout Ambassadors, was created for girls in ',
             u' 11 and 12 (around 16 to 18 years old), with Girl Scout Seniors to be only in ninth and tenth grade (around 14 to 16 years old) and grades for other levels were changed. The new levels were tried in approximately six councils in Spring 2008, and began national use after October 1, 2008.',
             u'Although troop membership has always and is still the most common way to participate in Girl Scouting, girls who do not desire or have the time to participate in traditional troop activities can still sign up as individual Girl Scouts, known as a ',
             u'. Juliettes attend activities independently and work individually on badges and awards. The term Juliette may be phased out in the future.',
             u'The ',
             u' program allows women (ages 18 and older) to be active in Girl Scouting while in college. Campus Girl Scouting is an organization that helps promote and build student involvement in the community, the local council, and the college campus through service.',
             u'The 20th National Council of the GSUSA launched the Mariner Girl Scout program in October 1934.',
             u" Similar to the Boy Scouts of Americas' ",
             u', the program was designed for older Girl Scouts interested in outdoor water-based activities. By the end of 1934, 12 Mariner ships were registered and the first two handbooks, ',
             u' and ',
             u' were published. The Mariner Girl Scout program remains active but in a smaller form; most girls have instead joined Sea Scouting, which has been co-ed since 1971.',
             u'There are programs for girls in unusual situations that make it difficult for them to participate in the standard program. The ',
             u' program helps daughters of incarcerated mothers to connect with their mothers and to have the mothers participate in Girl Scout activities. Another program, ',
             u', allows girls who are themselves in detention centers to participate in Scouting. Other initiatives try to help girls in rural areas or in public housing. There are also programs for American girls living overseas.',
             u'The national organization has its central headquarters in New York City. With a staff of 400, it is headed by a Chief Executive Officer and a 40-member National Board of Directors. Girl Scouts of the USA celebrated 100 years of history and welcomed its new chief executive officer, Anna Maria Ch\xe1vez, at its National Council Session/52nd Convention in Houston in November 2011.',
             u' The Chair of the National Board of Directors, the highest volunteer position, is Connie L. Lindsey.',
             u'Below the national organization are councils, which cover a large portion of a state or geographic region. Some councils own and run camps for the troops within its area of responsibility. Councils are usually subdivided into areas, called Neighborhoods, Service Units, or Associations (terms vary), which are program delivery areas that consist of troops at all age levels in a smaller area, such as a town.',
             u'The basic unit is the troop which may or may not be sponsored. In contrast to Boy Scout troop chartered organizations, Girl Scout troop sponsors do not own the troop. Troops range in size from as small as five to as large as 30 or more girls and may be divided into several patrols of 8 or fewer girls.',
             u'In 2004, the Girl Scouts of the USA hired a consultant "to help Girl Scouts develop a strategy to ensure our future success and growth". They set targets and implemented ways to change the organization for the better. In addition, six "Gap Teams" looked at ways for Girl Scouting to improve its structure to prepare for future growth and success for the organization.',
             u' This was following declines in membership and in revenue, as well as challenges in subsidizing programs for inner city girls. The governance Gap Team found that consolidation decreased confusion and provided economies of scale, and recommended an optimal council size of approximately 10,000 girls.',
             u' As of 2006, there were 312 regional Girl Scout councils, which own the 236,000 local troops and other groups.',
             u'As part of a 2006 reorganization, the National Board of Directors consolidated the 312 councils into 109 councils.',
             u'This was not without resistance; the Manitou Girl Scout Council in ',
             u' sued the national GSUSA in Federal District Court alleging breach of the Girl Scout charter. Although the suit was summarily dismissed with prejudice by the district court,',
             u' the ',
             u' overturned that decision, stating that a Girl Scout council agreement "was no different than a ',
             u' franchise". The decision of the appeals court maintained the status of the Manitou Council. As a result, there are 112 Girl Scout councils in the United States.',
             u'The Girl Scout Promise can be made in English, Spanish, or in ',
             u' with the same meaning.',
             u' To serve God and my country,',
             u'\nTo help people at all times,',
             u'\nAnd to live by the Girl Scout Law.',
             u'The Promise is often recited at Girl Scout troop meetings while holding up the ',
             u' of the right hand, which forms the Girl Scout sign. Girl Scout policy states that the organization does not endorse or promote any particular philosophy or religious belief. The movement is nonsectarian, founded on American democratic principles,one of which is freedom of religion. In this context, the word "God" may be interpreted by each Girl Scout depending on her individual spiritual beliefs, and Girl Scouts are free to substitute the word consistent with her beliefs, such as "Creator", "my faith", "Allah", etc.',
             u'The aim of the Girl Scouts is to help girls by pursuing four goals: developing their full potential; relating to others with increasing understanding, skill, and respect; developing a meaningful set of values to guide their actions and make sound decisions; and contributing to the improvement of society.',
             u'I will do my best to be',
             u'\nHonest and Fair,',
             u'\nFriendly and Helpful,',
             u'\nConsiderate and Caring,',
             u'\nCourageous and Strong, and',
             u'\nResponsible for what I say and do,',

             u'\nrespect authority,',
             u'\nuse resources wisely,',

             u'\nbe a sister to every Girl Scout.',
             u'The Girl Scout Law has been changed several times since 1912. The original Girl Scout Law written by Juliette Gordon Low was:',
             u' The Girl Scout Law',
             u'"Be Prepared."',
             u'"Do a Good Turn Daily"',
             u'For girls ages 5 to 14, the unifying look includes wearing a choice of a tunic, vest, sash for displaying official pins and awards, combined with their own solid white shirts and khaki pants or skirts. Girl Scouts in high school can also wear a scarf that unites their look with the sisterhood of Girl Scouts around the world. For adult members the unifying look of the uniform is a Girl Scout official scarf or tie for men, worn with the official membership pins, combined with their own navy blue business attire. Girl Scouts at the Daisy and Brownie levels will continue to have a full uniform ensemble available.',
             u'Girl Scout uniforms have changed significantly over the years from the original navy blue in 1912, to khaki in 1914, to the familiar green. The evolution has included uniforms with the specificity to designate each age level of Girl Scouting. Since 2008, Girl Scouts at each level have one required element (',
             u', ',
             u' or Vest) for the display of official pins and awards which will be required when girls participate in ceremonies or officially represent the Girl Scout Movement.',
             u'For all levels, earned awards go on the front of the vest or sash following official placements. Fun patches can be displayed on the back of their vest or sash. Girl Scout Daisies can chose a blue vest or a smock with a full uniform or white shirt and khaki pants and skirt. They have their own Daisy Pin and a choice of accessories. Girl Scout Brownies can chose a traditional brown vest or sash to be worn with the historic Brownie Pin and other uniform pieces or white shirt and khaki pants or skirts. Girl Scout Juniors wear their official vest or sash to display insignia including awards, coupled with a white shirt and khaki pants or skirt. Girl Scout Cadettes, Seniors and Ambassadors can chose a khaki sash or vest to go with khaki pants or skirt and a white shirt.',
             u'The adult uniform also changed, with registered women and men wearing navy blue business attire, again from their regular wardrobes. Also available for women are official sweaters and an insignia scarf, while men have the option of an official tie.',
             u'The current Girl Scouts of the USA logo was adopted in 2010, based on ',
             u"'s 1978 logo. Bass was a graphic designer known for his motion picture title sequences, most notably for ",
             u"'s ",

             u'The emblem designed by ',
             u' was the only emblem used for Girl Scout Pins through 1980. The 1978 GSUSA National Convention voted to use two logos, and allow Girl Scouts to pick which they wanted to wear as their Girl Scout Pin (for Girl Scout Juniors and up).',
             u'One of the original and continuing attractions of Girl Scouts is that girls become proficient campers and participate in many outdoor activities such as ',
             u' or ',
             u' with their troops. Troops do service projects such as carrying out flag ceremonies, collecting food for food drives, visiting nursing homes and Christmas caroling or other community services.',
             u' Troops may also plan and take extended trips such as visiting another part of the United States or even travel to another country. Troops may organize ',
             u' or learning events such as first aid training or attending live theatre. The Girl Scout activity most familiar to the general public may be the annual sale of ',
             u', which started in 1917 as a money-earning opportunity for the local council and troops.',

             u'A "Destination" may be a trip to one of the WAGGGS World Centres:',
             u'The Girl Scouts of the USA have many customs and traditions: camping, community service, singing, and money earning to support their activities. The Girl Scout Handshake and the Girl Scout signal for silence are two shared by WAGGGS member organizations. Other traditions include the Friendship Circle with "the squeeze," taking bandanas and homemade sit-upons on camping trips, and the buddy system.',
             u'"Bridging" is the process of going from one level to another. Bridging is usually done at the troop level, although area bridgings are often held. The girls that are bridging walk across a bridge to their new level and are greeted with the Girl Scout Handshake. There is a notable bridging ceremony held in San Francisco, as GS Juniors bridge to GS Cadettes over the ',

             u' and "Girl Scouts\' Own" are traditions throughout the world of Girl Scouting. World Thinking Day has occurred annually since 1926 on February 22, the birthday of both ',
             u' and ',
             u'. On World Thinking Day, Girl Scouts and Guides around the world think about their sisters in other lands;',
             u" Councils or local service units (associations) hold a celebration on or near this day, in which each participating troop gives a presentation of the culture and customs of a country selected by the troop. Many Girl Scouts in America celebrate Juliette Gordon Low's birthday on October 31, Founder's Day. The parties often include the girls dressing up in Halloween costumes, and serving birthday cake.",
             u'A "Girl Scouts\' Own" is a special ceremony that expresses the spirit of Girl Scouting when the girls reflect upon their feelings about Girl Scouting and the world around them. A "Girl Scouts\' Own" can have any theme, or none at all. It is a solemn time given for Girl Scouts to create a moment of their very own. It can be held at any time and include the girls\' troop or be held at any inter-troop gathering.',
             u'Members can earn awards appropriate for their age level. Originally called badges, the terminology has changed to Learning Petals for GS Daisies, GS Try-Its for Brownies, GS Badges for Juniors, and Charms and Interest Project awards for GS Cadettes, Seniors, and Ambassadors (older girls). These Girl Scout awards are expected to be renamed "badges" in 2012\u20132014. Girl Scout Daisies will still earn Learning Petals and will be able to earn "Leaves".',
             u' Girl Scouts at every level can also earn Journey Awards. Journeys have become a large part of the Girl Scout program. In 2011, there were three Journeys, with books and awards for each level: "It\'s Your World\u2014Change It!", "It\'s Your Planet\u2014Love It!", and "It\'s Your Story\u2014Tell It!".',
             u'The highest achievement in Girl Scouting is the ',
             u', which can only be earned by GS Seniors and Ambassadors. The highest award for GS Cadettes is the ',
             u' and ',
             u' is the highest award for Girl Scout Juniors. These awards require large-scale service projects showing leadership along with service hours.',
             u' The service projects must improve a current situation, such as restoring the eroded banks of a stream. These are the equivalent to the Eagle Scout honor among the Boy Scouts although it does not gain the same sort of recognition.',
             u'Girl Scouts can also earn and display on their uniform awards from outside organizations, such as the ',
             u' from religious organizations, or the ',
             u'. Girl Scouts can also receive awards for lifesaving and leadership.',
             u"There are also GS awards for adults including: Outstanding Volunteer, Outstanding Leader, Appreciation Pin, Honor Pin, Thanks Badge, and Thanks Badge II. Outstanding Volunteer is awarded for Outstanding service as Girl Scout volunteer (other than a leader). Outstanding Leader is awarded for Outstanding service as Girl Scout leader. Appreciation Pin is awarded for exceptional performance beyond expectations for the position. The Honor Pin recognizes an adult member who has delivered exceptional service beyond expectations to two or more geographic areas, service units or program delivery audiences in a way that furthers the council's goals.",
             u' Thanks Badge recognizes outstanding service for two or more "service units". Different GS councils use different terminology for regions within their council. Thanks Badge II is awarded where the recipient has received the Thanks Badge and the recipient\u2019s service continues to merit further recognition. At least one nomination, two endorsements, and a review of the forms is required for each of these awards.',

             u"For some individuals, the word 'God', no matter how broadly interpreted, does not appropriately reflect their spiritual beliefs.

             u'It is essential to maintain the spiritual foundation of Girl Scouting, yet be inclusive of the full range of spiritual beliefs. This [policy change] does not take the word \'God\' out of the Girl Scout Promise. It gives those individuals who wish to do so the option to state their commitment to the spiritual concepts fundamental to the Movement with a word or words more appropriate to their own beliefs. For instance, an individual may say \'my faith\' or \'Allah\' or \'the Creator\'."',
             u'Girl Scout President B. LaRae Orullian made an official statement that the change is "a very strong statement that Girl Scouts continue to be on the cutting edge, and this is a continuing effort to show that we have strength in diversity and that we are an inclusive organization."',
