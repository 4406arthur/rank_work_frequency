There are probably many beautiful women who love getting free stuff and lots of attention from random strangers. However, those who would like a monogamous relationship can find it a real challenge. The men confident enough to approach them are often players, and they intimidate lots of other men. ", "I think you make an excellent point about earning admiration. A beautiful woman may get a lot of guys chasing her, but she will often feel that they don\u2019t see the real her. Her looks get in the way. And as you say, gratuitous sexual attention is offensive.

The subject of narcissism is an interest of mine and I recently read a very revealing book on the subject. Many people view narcissism as someone who loves themselves. However narcissists dont and cannot love themselves or others. They are obsessed with creating a fixed mask to hide emotional numbness.  They cannot accept their true authentic \u2018self\u2019. They seek power (in their image) to dominate from a deep fear of being humiliated. Its something thats thought to be caused by some emotional trauma in childhood\u2026the source of which is outside the scope of this post\u2026", "But there is a wider concept of narcissism in our society now days that did not used to exist to such an extent. The image \u2013 how we look and display ourself \u2013 is of huge importance in our society. This is my opinion is out of balance. Core values of dignity, respect and authenticity in our society take second place now to appearance and power. Previously in cultures an individual would gain high status from having a dignified and wise character. However now we have the age of celebrity where people will do anything to gain power through fame \u2013 they are prepared to trash their dignity in order to get it.", "\nHow does this relate to female issues? Well its understood by some that looks count for females \u2013 more so than males. I propose then a narcissistic society will only take this (proposed) evolutionary norm and drive it out of balance.

As opposed to the surface image-to which huge value is attributed. No wonder beautiful women feel angry-its like they are being put on a pedestal for only one fraction of their potential. So rarely do I ever hear of anyone praising how nurturing, caring, loving a girl is. And at worst if someone is very caring they can even be manipulated or used-rather than adored and praised for this trait. All billboards ever display is physical beauty. I never read an advert that says \u2018She blooms life, she pours love and nurture into her children to create positivity, The foundation of life is built on her love \u2013 the glue that holds the family unit together\u2026\u2019.", "\nMaybe thats just not sexy enough and sex sells \u2013 our society is obsessed with a sort of immature form of sex \u2013 rather than a true representation of what sex is. Narcissistic also I guess.", "\nJust like us humans are not living in balance with the earth at the mo (destroying it and trying to control it), I also believe our society is completely out of touch with the importance of the feminine nature. Its kind of shameful when I think about it\u2026of course there are worse examples (Sharia law etc) \u2013 but still \u2013 its something that often people dont realise how important it is perhaps because we are now so bombarded by image all the time rather than taught the issues of real value in life.", "Steve, I agree completely. Does the book you read go into this more contemporary view of narcissism? I\u2019m quite interested in this topic. Actually, I just put up a post that addresses what you\u2019re talking about here.

I also got called a snobby bitch twice by different guys after I didn\u2019t respond to their passing comments (even though I smiled politely). Wow. Then on the drive home my flatmate asked me again why I don\u2019t have a boyfriend and told me I was really weird because of it (he had been constantly hitting on me lately which makes my life so uncomfortable). Lastly I talked to a guy I met recently and have hungout with a few times and talk to a lot online\u2026 super funny, smart, good looking.. which I thought was finally a good sign and that he liked me or whatever\u2026 then he proceeded to tell me that he was \u2018pleasantly suprised at how pleasant I was\u2019 after getting to know me. I questioned this, to which he pretty much stated he expected me to be dumb because I look like a shallow and fashionable person, and that he was suprised that I love to read and know about things he doesn\u2019t. Like Kierkegaard. Or Lutherism. Um, is that a compliment? I look like a dumb snobby bitch\u2026 thanks. By this stage I wanted to cry myself to sleep. Ha.

You just might not be presenting yourself as your best through body language because of your bitterness and self-preoccupation with not being good enough.   90% of communication is body language.  There are so many good looking, cool and great guys and girls out there who are not representing themselves very well so people don\u2019t end up seeing these great qualities.  For example, if there are two identical twins who are both equally gorgeous who do you think will be preferred the girl with the open, kind and enthusiastic disposition or the girl who is closed off and too afraid to show just how great she is?  To wrap this up, it\u2019s a confidence thing.  So maybe focus on how you can let your great qualities (i\u2019m sure you have a lot!) show and how you can change your body language into an open one which will welcome and invite attention from the right guys.

Every time that I\u2019m sitting home on a Saturday night alone wondering why all of my friends are in relationships and yet I\u2019m not, I turn to this and feel slightly better. It\u2019s rough because when someone claims that they\u2019re ugly, then the world cannot hear enough of it.

I have gotten things for free, been complimented by random strangers and things like that. HOWEVER. I have also been followed, I have been sexually harassed by men on the street and have had a harder time making friends (male and female alike). With being an attractive female there comes this expectation that that is all you do. That if you look better than those around you, then you must be a diva or something. So yeah, the girl next to you in the jeans and t-shirt is probably going to get the actual conversation from the guys. Meanwhile you\u2019ll just get the stares and side glances from across the room. It\u2019s just frustrating. Just like every situation in life, being good looking does have its problems. And I\u2019m not just whining. Additionally, while everyone avoids you because you\u2019re attractive, there is also an insane pressure from the media and society (like we haven\u2019t heard this before) to stay that way!

If men want to hold women to such high expectations in gene contribution, women should hold men to those same standards.

There are very few people I connect with on a similar and general level, and this seems to be with most people of varying levels of attractiveness. The fact that you have these beta male orbiters constantly around you suggests you desire attention, not genuine connection with them as anyone is unlikely to make genuine connections with large amounts of people, it\u2019s just not human nature.

Physically I find fit but curvy women to plus size women (well proportioned). I don not find very thin women attractive nor do I find a woman 50 + lbs overweight attractive. Intellectually I am attracted to a woman who can hold a stimulating conversation but has a volatile sense of humor and does not take herself, nor life, too seriously. I am usually attracted to or approach women who are shorter than me, but I have approached women taller with no prejudice. All in all I am far from perfect but if I have rejected a woman I have made an effort to only reject them based on several aspects of their looks and character. A woman rejecting a man who fits all her criteria except in the height department is shallow. It CAN NOT be perceived as a preference. The word preference inherently implies a desire but not mandatory. Further if a man rejects a woman due to her breast size or her weight or her facial features alone HE TOO IS SHALLOW. A majority of women simply revel in the ability to maintain double standards. It is a back-lash of women\u2019s lib. DO NOT MISCONSTRUE MY WORDs! I believe women are entitled to equality. But I liken it to \u2018catholic schoolgirl syndrome\u2019. Many women mistaken overly selective standards in dating, rampant promiscuity and sexually suggestive or provocative clothing as liberating. They in most cases are not and detrimental to women and relationships in general. Women have simply been repressed for so long many of them mistake the ability to \u2018flaunt it\u2019 or being nit-picky in selection of men as an exercising of their freedom. Just because I have the freedom to say what I wish doesn\u2019t mean I should. Conversely, just because a woman has the freedom to sleep around doesn\u2019t mean she should. This rant aside I simply feel there is an aspect of women\u2019s lib that has made a good portion of women hate men and view them as enemies. Thus they feel: \u201cmen are really all pigs and bad so I\u2019m going to find the best looking one, the most wealthy to father my children, that way  if things don\u2019t work out I at least have good looking children and can get some of his money\u201d.

According to our understanding of hypergamy, women get an inflated sense of SMV due to the notion that men above them in SMV approach them often and obtain only easy sex from them. Combine that with the fact that the extroverted and confident men are doing the majority of the approaching, and that hedges most women\u2019s numbers arbitrarily higher than most would believe them to be, using his equation.", "I think the best way to base a woman\u2019s SMV would be to judge the attractiveness of the men who have committed to her.

A woman is approached by 100 men. Of the 100 men, 20% have high SMV (7-10) in her opinion while 80% have lower SMV (1-6) in her opinion. This coincides with the idea that women generally only find 20% of men attractive. Let\u2019s say that the woman sleeps with a few of the men with high SMV. She might believe that she has a high SMV due to the fact that high SMV males approached her and slept with her. The problem is that, unlike women, men have no qualms with sleeping with women who may be below them in SMV. The catch occurs when high SMV males want to find a woman to commit to. The tables turn then and high SMV males seek out women who have equal or greater SMV than they do.

I try to give every woman a chance, yes even the pretty ones.  I just can\u2019t get passed a pretty girl\u2019s prissy gaze (or bored international model look).  I like human qualities that are somewhat down to earth.  So, when I was in my early 20\u2032s I didn\u2019t have much in the way of luck.  One 5 year relationship with someone that had major bipolar issues, destroyed the relationship and left her dirty sandbox for another man.  I then met some women who REALLY likes me for maybe a month or as long as 3 months and then lost interest.  I met many extremes, either super prudish or too nasty.  It seemed like all of the ones I met didn\u2019t connect well with having a \u201cnormal life\u201d.  I was looking for  a REAL relationship and I just wasn\u2019t getting it.  Trust me, men looking for real relationships aren\u2019t liked as much as women claim.  Women say a lot of stuff, but I don\u2019t see it in reality as much as a hear it.  When I got in my 30\u2032s, I would get women who would walk up to me and before she even asked me what my favorite color was, she was asking me what I did for a living.  Honestly I would rather by objectified than all out used.  I would tell them what I did, and they would walk on.   I felt like they were trying to cherry pick or something.  No such thing as finding someone they LIKE and building something together.  They were looking for a ready package.  I would also meet women on blind dates.  Usually from meeting her on the phone or some other way.  When she saw me and she wasn\u2019t attracted to me, she would ask me questions to give her reasons to shoot me down.  I know this was the case because often the same gal when end up with a guy that\u2019s a total loser.  Who do they come crying to when all the males of the world are such jerks?\u2026 ME.   It got to the point where I was getting sick of being a shoulder for them.  While they were out enjoying themselves, I was home alone.   It wasn\u2019t until their shallow lifestyle fell apart, that I became important.  In my late 30\u2032s and early 40\u2032s I started to have used to be pretty girls and 2 widows come after me.  In my experience, widows are VERY aggressive.  They want to marry a guy quickly and they don\u2019t seem to be nearly as fussy.  I also noticed that even the unattractive MARRIED women (who I knew from back when they were very pretty) were starting to show interest.  Again, I\u2019m seeing destructive behavior that I don\u2019t fully understand.  I don\u2019t find it very flattering to be rejected for years and then suddenly become interesting as soon as a woman\u2019s looks falls apart.  It\u2019s not that I\u2019m shallow, but I don\u2019t want to be somebody\u2019s left over either.  So I got stuck in the middle.  The young women had too much to learn and acted impossible and the older women seemed to be looking for someone out of desperation.  Both situations were rather annoying.  I started looking back at all the pretty girls who rejected me or who stayed with me for a short time and then dumped me.  What I found is that even to this day, they don\u2019t have a \u201cnormal\u201d life.  No kids, no family, no husband.  I find that so confusing because they seemed to have it so easy. Why is their life such a disaster?  Some of them want me now, but I avoid them.  Not always because of their looks.  I just see where their life is, and I don\u2019t want to be drug down.  I am a guy that has NO debt.  I\u2019m buying my own home.  I have held a job since high school.  I am fairly fit.  Have well most of my hair. In college learning.  I don\u2019t drink, smoke, cuss or do drugs.  I\u2019ve never cheated on anyone.  I have always want a REAL relationship and have always been picked over for scumbags.  Guys who might have been maybe a little more attractive or had a better social position (more money) and that\u2019s it.  I definitely don\u2019t pick women the way some of the women I\u2019ve seen pick men.  I don\u2019t always pick the prettiest women.  If they\u2019re trouble or a scumbag, I pass them right up.  Being pretty only gets their foot in the door.  Of course, on the flip side, being ugly won\u2019t do them much good no matter how sweet they are.  In fact, a guy sometimes expects unattractive women to be nice.  Some even joke that women are never nice unless they have to be.  I don\u2019t believe that, but I think it\u2019s funny because I\u2019ve seen at least partial truth to is.  Now I\u2019m 44 years old.  My aging mom is asking me why I haven\u2019t gotten married yet.  It makes me sad because I really wanted a \u201cnormal\u201d life.  I wanted her to have a grandchild but I could never find anyone.  At least not anyone who wasn\u2019t damaged and/or useless.   At this age I will sometimes have women walk up to me and tell me why I\u2019m not dating.  Sometimes even 40 year old women who don\u2019t seem to be dating anyone themselves and they\u2019re telling me what I\u2019m doing wrong.  This makes me take several steps back because fist of all, how do they know I\u2019m not dating?  Is it that obvious?  Even if it IS that obvious, isn\u2019t it rude to walk up to someone and basically say, \u201cI can obviously tell you\u2019re not dating\u201d?  I still get the women asking me what I do for a living.  At this age, I\u2019m starting to get a type of woman I didn\u2019t get before.  20 something gals are acting interested and VERY sweet but it doesn\u2019t go anywhere.  It\u2019s almost like they\u2019re acting nice because they believe I\u2019m not in their radar anymore.  Anyway, I have a feeling most people reading this is probably thinking I\u2019m unattractive or something.   Well, I\u2019m not the best but I\u2019m definitely not the worst.  The honest truth, I haven\u2019t met a woman yet who couldn\u2019t get someone out of her league (so to speak) and some of them probably don\u2019t even realize this because many will down play their guy.  I look at the guy their with  and listen to them say that they really weren\u2019t that attracted to him but liked him after they go to know him.  I look at him with a six pack and her with a big flowery blouse and somewhat of a couch potato look and I\u2019m thinking it but I\u2019m not saying anything.. I think find out that he\u2019s even making a fair amount of money..  So then I start to think to myself, my gosh, if women who are not even up the the point of average looking can get guys LIKE THAT, I might as well hang it up.  Not that I\u2019m shallow, but I do like something a little nice to look at.  I don\u2019t blame those couch potatoes for getting the best that they can get either.   Even if I wanted someone REALLY unattractive there would be the problem of only being wanted because they\u2019re desperate.  I know I\u2019m sounding mean, but I\u2019m not trying to.  I\u2019m just calling it as I see it.  I am nice to women I\u2019m not attracted to and I befriend them.  Something pretty women don\u2019t always do with me (well sometimes they do).

Has it ever occurred to you that you enjoyed the same kind of attention when you were in your 20s and probably ignored all the guys in your age group who have no other choice than to become the very men you now condemn as they grow older and more mature.  Is it fair to me that I have to compete with guys that are 10+years older than me (I am 26) for women my age?  I have never judged a woman by her looks alone and I have always pursued women that I got to know first, I would be their friend and enjoy intelligent conversations and flirting with them.  Not all of us guys are shallow but being a decent person who treats women with kindness and respect and actually tries to get to know them before pursuing them has yielded no results for me whatsoever.  Some women have unrealistic expectations, others feel entitled to guys that are way above their league because they can offer sex, other women just like being treated like garbage.  Some very average women who have nothing going on for them in terms of personality and achievements will often expect to be courted by the most amazing guys, which is something that society has instilled in their minds through all these retarded romantic comedies.  Many beautiful women expect to be carried by their good looks through life and in many ways this is a fact of life.  Even if she settles for an average looking guy who has an amazing personality what\u2019s stopping her from cheating on him with the next player that can provide a short lived thrill, seeing that women mostly rely on emotions than reason in their choice making.  In addition, I believe it is very easy to see whether someone is genuinely interested in you or just for your looks.
